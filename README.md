# whisper-intro
Documentation, code and a jupyter notebook, which enables you to run Whisper on Kubeflow

The material in this repo is designed to help users get started with Whisper running on Kubeflow.

Whisper is a new open source, general-purpose speech recognition model from OpenAI, which was trained on a large data set (680k hours). As you can see from the chart, Whisper performs very well when compared to leading open source models, commercial models, and humans. As you may remember from the #kubeflow Summit and the Kubeflow survey, we have received requests to highlight integrations with new models. To that end, I have created a jupyter notebook that demonstrates four Whisper models running on a Kubeflow notebook. It includes a use case that will enable you to use your microphone to record and transcribe. You can find the notebook in this GitHub repo and I hope this short intro will spur more improvements on tutorials in this space.
